                    <h3> Founder & Chairwoman Patty Brisben started Pure Romance from the basement of her suburban Ohio home in 1993. Using the latest sexual health 
                        education, the best in must-have beauty products, and the hottest bedroom accessories, Patty empowered, educated, and entertained the women 
                        at her parties—helping them fulfill their desires while offering them the chance to own their own business and achieve their dreams exactly 
                        the way she did.

                        Today, we’re still all about empowering, educating, and entertaining women—the only difference? We’re doing it on a much larger scale than we 
                        ever could have imagined. As Pure Romance continued to grow, Patty was joined by her son, CEO & President Chris Cicchinelli, in 2000. Together, 
                        they’ve transformed Pure Romance into a $350 million company with 45,000 active Partners all over the world. Those Partners, located in the 
                        United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, and Australia, all inspire women to enhance their intimate lives, take charge of their sexual 
                        health, and just maybe, take a leap and start a life-changing career.

                        Giving Back At its core, Pure Romance is a company that strives to improve the lives of women. Through talking to thousands of women each year, 
                        Patty realized the crucial need for more education, research, and community awareness about women’s sexual health, something that’s essential to 
                        every woman’s wellbeing. To respond to that need, in 2005, Patty established the Patty Brisben Foundation for Women’s Sexual Health. This 
                        nonprofit organization funds clinical research and education for women’s sexual health, aiming to raise awareness about these sensitive subjects 
                        while working with health care providers to help them improve the quality of life for women everywhere. Ask to join VIP group via Facebook!
